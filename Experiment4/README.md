Aim : Local and Global State Management in React

Learning Outcomes :

    1. Differentiate between local and global state in React
    Explain when state should be kept inside a single component versus shared across multiple components.

    2. Implement local state using useState
    Manage and update component-specific data such as form inputs, toggles, or UI visibility.

    3. Share data between components using global state
    Use a global state approach (such as Context API or a state management library) to avoid excessive prop drilling.

    4. Identify and reduce prop drilling
    Recognize when passing props through many component levels becomes inefficient and refactor using shared state.
